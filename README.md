# Computer-Controller-Hardware
This device allows you to control your computer by sending commands over WiFi through a TCP socket. This code is run by a Raspberry Pi Pico connected to an ESP8266 for WiFi. The two devices use AT commands to communicate connecting to the WiFi and other devices, and a few buttons are wired for sending commands. This device acts was designed with replicating an everyday TV remote, but instead for your computer.

A picture of the wiring diagram is attached below and the ckt file in the repository can be opened with Cirkit Designer
